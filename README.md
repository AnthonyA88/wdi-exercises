# WDI Exercises

Optional additional, repetitive practice exercises for students for all WDI topics.

Ideally, every topic introduced to students has an accompanying set of these exercises. The goal is to provide controlled
for students and provide bite-sized practice. 

Any given exercise shouldn't take students longer than 30 minutes! The shorter the exercise assignment, the better.
